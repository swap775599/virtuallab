Virtual Classroom Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Virtual Classroom project is a web application designed to facilitate online learning. It allows administrators (instructors) to manage classes, units, sessions, and lectures. Students can access course material and participate in discussions. The application is built using Java, JSP, and MySQL.

Key Files
SpringBootApplication.java: Main entry point of the application.
LogicController.java: Handles HTTP requests for login and comment posting.
UserService.java: Contains business logic for user authentication and comment handling.
UserRepository.java: Manages database operations for user entities.
CommentRepository.java: Manages database operations for comment entities.
User.java: Entity representing a user.
Comment.java: Entity representing a comment.
application.properties: Configuration file for database and other settings.
login.jsp, class.jsp, edit.jsp: Front-end JSP files for different functionalities.
Setting Up the Project
Create a New Spring Boot Project: Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to set up a new Spring Boot project with dependencies for Web, JPA, and MySQL.

Add Dependencies:

Update pom.xml with dependencies for Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL, and any other required libraries.
Features
Admin/Instructor Management: Administrators can manage classes, units (books), sessions (chapters), and lectures.
Student Access: Enrolled students can access course material and participate in discussions.
Discussion System: Users can add comments on lectures, and comments can be nested for discussions.
Role-Based Access: Only enrolled students can join classes.
Project Components
Front-End: HTML and CSS for the user interface.
Back-End: Java classes and Servlets for business logic and database interaction.
Database: MySQL for data storage.
1. Database Setup
1.1. Create Database and Tables
Run the following SQL scripts to create the necessary database and tables:
1.2. MySQL Configuration
Database URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/virtual_classroom
Username: root
Password: your_password
Ensure the MySQL JDBC driver is added to your project's classpath.

Configure Database:

Set up the MySQL database and create the schema.
Update application.properties with your MySQL database connection details.
Create Entities and Repositories:

Define the User and Comment entities.
Create the corresponding repositories (UserRepository, CommentRepository).
Implement Business Logic:

Write the UserService to handle authentication and comment management.
Implement the LogicController to manage HTTP requests.
Create JSP Templates:

Design the login.jsp, class.jsp, and edit.jsp pages according to your UI requirements.
Run the Application:

Use the command mvn spring-boot:run or run the SpringBootApplication.java file from your IDE.
Running the Application
Ensure MySQL is Running: Make sure your MySQL server is up and running.

Run the Spring Boot Application:

Execute mvn spring-boot:run from the terminal or run SpringBootApplication.java directly from your IDE.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.
Conclusion
This setup guide provides a structured approach to creating a virtual classroom web application using Spring Boot. It covers the essential components, project structure, and steps needed to get the application up and running.
