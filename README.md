Approach Document for Virtual Classroom
Project Overview
The Virtual Classroom app lets instructors manage classes, units (books), and sessions (chapters), while students can view lectures, participate in discussions, and only enrolled students can join a class. We built the project using Java, Spring Boot, JSP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.
Technologies and Approach
1. Backend Technology: Java, Spring Boot
We used Java and Spring Boot to handle the server-side logic and manage communication between the web app and database.
•	Why Spring Boot?
Spring Boot makes it easy to build web applications by reducing the amount of code we need to write. It provides built-in features to help with setting up APIs, connecting to the database, and managing user interactions.
•	RESTful APIs:
We created API endpoints that allow the system to perform tasks like creating classes, adding sessions, and handling user actions. These APIs are protected using Spring Security to control who can access certain features (e.g., only instructors can add classes).
2. Frontend Technology: JSP, HTML, CSS
We chose JSP to create dynamic web pages, and HTML/CSS to design the structure and style of those pages.
•	Why JSP?
JSP lets us generate HTML on the server and show content based on the data we fetch from the backend. It helps display user-specific content like class details and session information.
•	HTML & CSS:
HTML is used to create the structure of the web pages, and CSS helps us make the pages look nice and responsive across devices.
3. Database: MySQL
We used MySQL to store information about users, classes, units, sessions, and lecture materials.
•	Why MySQL?
MySQL is a reliable, easy-to-use database that lets us store and retrieve data efficiently. We used Spring Data JPA to easily map our Java objects to database tables.
•	Database Structure:
o	User Table: Stores user information like usernames, passwords, and roles.
o	Classroom Table: Stores information about each class.
o	Unit Table: Stores units that belong to a class.
o	Session Table: Stores sessions that belong to a unit.
We used JPA annotations to define relationships between tables, like "one-to-many" (e.g., a class can have multiple units) and "many-to-one" (e.g., a session belongs to one unit).
4. Security: Spring Security
We implemented Spring Security to manage login, authentication, and role-based access.
•	Role-Based Access:
We set up three main roles: Admin, Instructor, and Student. Each role has different permissions. For example, only instructors can create and manage classes, while students can only view and join them.
•	Password Encryption:
User passwords are encrypted using BCrypt to ensure they are stored securely.
•	Login/Logout:
Users log in through a form, and after logging in, the system tracks their session securely.
5. MVC Architecture
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:
•	Model: Represents the data (e.g., user, classroom, session).
•	View: The JSP files that present data to the user.
•	Controller: Handles the logic of how data moves between the model and view.
6. Containerization (Docker)
We can containerize the project using Docker for easy deployment and to make it scalable.
•	Why Docker?
Docker lets us package the app so it can run in different environments (e.g., development, production) without worrying about configuration issues. It makes scaling the app easier to support more users.
7. Discussion Feature (Nested Comments)
We added a feature for students to comment on lectures. The comments can be nested, meaning users can reply to other comments, creating threads.
•	How It Works:
Each comment can have a "parent comment," allowing us to create a thread-like structure where students can discuss lecture topics.
8. Performance and Real-Time Data
We optimized the application to make sure it can handle real-time interactions, such as displaying updated lecture material and comments.
•	Efficient Data Fetching:
We make sure to only fetch the data we need for each page, improving load times.
•	Caching (Future Plan):
We can add caching (like using Redis) to make frequently accessed data load faster.
Design Approach
1.	User Login and Roles
Users log in with specific roles: Admin, Instructor, or Student. Based on their role, users can perform different actions. For example:
o	Admin: Can manage all users and classes.
o	Instructor: Can create and manage their own classes and sessions.
o	Student: Can only view and participate in the classes they are enrolled in.
2.	Classroom and Course Management
Instructors can create a class with multiple units (like books), and each unit can have several sessions (like chapters). Students enrolled in the class can access the materials for each session.
3.	Responsive UI
The frontend is designed to work well on different devices, including smartphones and tablets.
________________________________________
Conclusion
This Virtual Classroom project uses popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JSP, and MySQL to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for online learning. By using Spring Security, following MVC architecture, and focusing on scalability with Docker, the app is well-prepared for real-world deployment.
