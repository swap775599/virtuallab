Students can access course material and participate in discussions. The application is built using Java, JSP, and MySQL.

Features
Admin/Instructor Management: Administrators can manage classes, units (books), sessions (chapters), and lectures.
Student Access: Enrolled students can access course material and participate in discussions.
Discussion System: Users can add comments on lectures, and comments can be nested for discussions.
Role-Based Access: Only enrolled students can join classes.
Project Components
Front-End: HTML and CSS for the user interface.
Back-End: Java classes and Servlets for business logic and database interaction.
Database: MySQL for data storage.
